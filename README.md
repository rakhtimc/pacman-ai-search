# pacman-ai-search

This repository contains solutions to the Pacman AI Search problems. The search problem includes implementation of uninformed search algorithms like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform cost search, and A star search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
